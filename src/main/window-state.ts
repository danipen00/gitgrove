// since it was written — an external display unplugged, resolution lowered,
// the dock moved. Everything here therefore treats the stored values as
// untrusted input and reconciles them against the displays that exist *now*.
// The contract: the restored window is always visible and grabbable — enough
// of its title bar sits on a real screen to read and drag — no matter what
// happened to the monitors in between.
//
// Kept free of Electron imports so it can be unit-tested directly (bun:test
// has no Electron runtime); the file/event glue lives in window-state-store.ts.
